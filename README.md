# Ishara-Setu

Ishara-Setu is a Nepali Sign Language recognition project that includes data collection, image preprocessing, machine learning model training, and a user interface for real-time recognition.

## Project Structure

- `1. Data Collection/`: Scripts for collecting and shuffling data.
- `2. Image Preprocessing/`: Image preprocessing steps and sample images.
- `3. Images To Pickle/`: Scripts to convert images to pickle format.
- `4. ML Codes/`: Machine learning model training, validation, and reports.
- `5. Analysis/`: Analysis images and reports.
- `6. UI/`: User interface scripts and resources.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages listed in `requirement.txt`.

## Usage

- Use the scripts in `1. Data Collection/` to collect and prepare data.
- Preprocess images using scripts in `2. Image Preprocessing/`.
- Train and validate models using scripts in `4. ML Codes/`.
- Use the UI in `6. UI/` for real-time sign language recognition.

## Notes

- Large model files, datasets, and generated files are excluded from the repository to keep it lightweight.
- Please refer to the project files for detailed implementation.
